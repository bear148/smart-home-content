            <!--<p>All in all, our smart houses aim to cram as much technology into each individual house as possible, so that we can make your living easier. Our houses include ammenities such as, automatic dish handling so you no longer have to worry about those dirty dishes, automatic stove that cooks and portions all the food you'll need for each meal of the day, mice that are automatically deployed to clean, a garage with a car that automatically start and open when you need to leave for the day, and that is only to mention a few things. The house is also very spacious and comes with a floor above the 1st floor, and even a cellar that includes an incinerator for any trash. The house in it's entirety is built with the buyer's time in mind, and unlike many other houses, not only do our homes provide you with a roof, but they actually care for you physically.</p>-->
