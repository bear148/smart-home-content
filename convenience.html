        <p>The main purpose of our smart houses is to make your life easier, and that is what we have accomplished by adding a slew of features and robots that will help automate some of the boring housekeeping tasks. Some of the most important and useful utilities our smart house offers are, cleaning mice, automatic stove for cooking, automatic dishwasher, cigar dispenser, automatic car, automatic garage, clocks that announce the time, and many more.</p>

            <h3>Ammenity List</h3> 
            <p>Here is a comprehensive list and description for all of the convenience ammenities we include:</p>

                    Everyone hates having to clean off dirty plates when they're in the sink, especially when they have food on them. To combat this we added a robotic arm that will scrape the food off the plates. This food will then fall into a garbage disposal and the dishes will automatically be placed into a dishwasher.

                    Having to constantly check calenders, schedules, watches, phones, clocks, anything can get pretty inconvient at times. However, we've added small speakers to each room that can be voice activated to announce the current time, date, and other information regarding potential events or schedules. Now, you can stay up to date in any room by simply asking. Also, the speakers will announce the time and any upcoming events at the start of every hour except at night. This will be handled by the brain which can detect when all the house occupants are in their beds, and will then mute the announcements until the voice alarms go off.
