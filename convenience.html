                            Everyone hates having to clean off dirty plates when they're in the sink, especially when they have food on them. To combat this we added a robotic arm that will scrape the food off the plates. This food will then fall into a garbage disposal and the dishes will automatically be placed into a dishwasher. Now you don't have to worry about touching dirty dishes!

                                Having to constantly check calenders, schedules, watches, phones, clocks, anything can get pretty inconvient at times. However, we've added small speakers to each room that can be voice activated to announce the current time, date, and other information regarding potential events or schedules. Now, you can stay up to date in any room by simply asking. Also, the speakers will announce the time and any upcoming events at the start of every hour except at night. This will be handled by the brain which can detect when all the house occupants are in their beds, and will then mute the announcements until the voice alarms go off.
                                You can also use these as alarm clocks. These voice clocks can be set to go off at a specific time by using an assortment of different sounds or introductions. Now, you have simply eliminated the need for an alarm clock at your bedside. You can also choose to snooze the clocks via voice commands. It is more cost effective to purchase these clocks because they make it easier for you to manage your time in general.

                        The weather is always changing, and today's world is no exception! The weather can be tough to battle with when it comes to determining what to wear or what to bring with you when you leave the house. We here at Smart Homes Incorporated have developed a solution to yet another one of your daily inconviences. This weather box is mounted at the front door and can tell you todays weather, as well as what you may want to bring with you when you leave. These suggestions are dependant on the weather. For example, if it was currently or going to rain outside, the weather box will announce, <q>Today is September 9th, 2024. There is a 87% chance of rain today. Make sure to bring an umbrella before you leave!</q> This is really helpful for not only staying informed, but as a reminder as well. No one wants to forget today is gonna be a rainy day, and then end up outside in shorts and a t-shirt while its pouring.

                        Having to constantly dust or vacuum your house can be a hassle, so we've developed a solution to that too! These robotic mice will scatter around your house at requested or scheduled times and clean all those hard to reach places. These mice are able to dust, vacuum, and remove small pieces of debris that may not be picked up by your regular vacuum. These mice are much more compact than regular cleaning solutions, and they store themselves on their own, so you don't have to worry about recharging or emptying them.

                        Don't you hate having to run the heater or air conditioning when it gets hot or cold outside? Of course you want to be comfortable in your own house, but then again, it costs <em>so</em> much to run these things. Then, it gets even worse when you get into bed for the night. No one likes trying to fall asleep while they are overheated and sweating. So, to combat this, our new beds with built in cooling and heating coils will keep you feeling comfortable at night no matter what the temperature outside may be. Sleep is already one of the most important things for ensuring you wake up refreshed and ready for the day, so why not guarantee that for yourself by sleeping comfortably in our temperature controlled beds?

                        Everyone uses a car in some capacity to get where they need to go. Having to wait for a car to startup and for the garage door to open can take away from your precious time. Therefore, we've now made it so you can either schedule a time for your car and garage to start automatically, or to do so on demand. This will help you save time by allowing you to focus on any last minute things while your ride is being prepared for you.

                        Whenever you go to turn on the shower, waiting for the water to heat up can be quite annoying, especially when you just want to take a nice hot shower before going to bed, or to wake yourself up in the morning. Imagine how nice it would be if you can step into the bathroom and have an already steaming hot shower or bath waiting there for you. If you are that person, you're in luck! We offer a bathtub that allows you to prefill it on command with either cold or hot water! The heating solution we use is the same as the beds, and so we are able to guarantee that the time it takes to heat the water has been cut in half compared to your regular old water heater. Now, not only do you not have to wait for the water to heat up, it will already be ready for you!

                        Not only have we gone all out with everything inside the house, but we've gone all out with the things outside as well. One of our newest features we offer are smart sprinklers for your garden. These smart sprinkles know everything about your garden. They can detect what plants you have, how much to water them, the <abbr title="Acidity">pH level</abbr> of the water, and the current state of the plants as well. These sprinkles are perfect for the people who want a garden, but don't want to worry about having to care for there plants as often. Thanks to our sprinklers however, you can know totally forget about needing to care about your plants. These will help automate the task and make it easier to have a garden, but without the hassle.

                        In addition to the cleaning mice and <a href="/safety.html#rats">firefighting rats</a>, we have also developped some larger mice that will carry away trash into the cellar's incinerator. They are essentially the same concept, just larger in size. They still retain their self-recharging, deploying, and emptying features like the cleaning mice.
