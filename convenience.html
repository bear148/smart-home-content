                    <p>
                        Everyone hates having to clean off dirty plates when they're in the sink, especially when they have food on them. To combat this we added a robotic arm that will scrape the food off the plates. This food will then fall into a garbage disposal and the dishes will automatically be placed into a dishwasher. Now you don't have to worry about touching dirty dishes!

                    <p>
                        Having to constantly check calendars, phones, and clocks can get pretty inconvenient at times. Fortunately, we've added small speakers to each room that can be voice activated to announce the current time, date, and other information regarding potential events or schedules. Now, you can stay up to date in any room by simply asking.

                <p>
                    The weather is always changing, and today's world is no exception! The weather can be tough to battle with when it comes to determining what to wear or what to bring with you when you leave the house. This weather box is mounted at the front door and can tell you today’s weather, as well as what you may want to bring with you when you leave. These suggestions are dependent on the weather.

                <p>
                    Having to constantly dust or vacuum your house can be a hassle, so we've developed a solution to that too! These robotic mice will scatter around your house at requested or scheduled times and clean all those hard to reach places. These mice are able to dust, vacuum, and remove small pieces of debris that may not be picked up by your regular vacuum. These mice are much more compact than regular cleaning solutions, and they store themselves on their own, so you don't have to worry about recharging or emptying them.

                        Having to wait for a car to startup and for the garage door to open can take away from your precious time. Therefore, we've now made it so you can demand when you want your car and garage to start. This will help you save time by allowing you to focus on any last minute things while your ride is being prepared for you.

                <p>
                    Whenever you go to turn on the shower, waiting for the water to heat up can be quite annoying. Imagine how nice it would be if you can step into the bathroom and have an already steaming hot shower or bath waiting there for you. Luckily, we offer a bathtub that allows you to prefill it on command with either cold or hot water!  Now, not only do you not have to wait for the water to heat up, it will already be ready for you!

                   One of our newest features we offer are smart sprinklers for your garden. These smart sprinkles know everything about your garden. They can detect what plants you have, how much to water them, the <abbr title="Acidity">pH level</abbr> of the water, and the current state of the plants as well. These sprinkles are perfect for the people who want a garden, but don't want to worry about having to care for there plants as often. These sprinklers will help automate the task and make it easier to have a garden, but without the hassle.

                <p>
                    In addition to the cleaning mice and <a class="body-link" href="/safety.html#rats">firefighting rats</a>, we have also developed some larger mice that will carry away trash into the cellar's incinerator. They are essentially the same concept, just larger in size. They still retain their self-recharging, deploying, and emptying features like the cleaning mice.
