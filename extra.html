                             Everyone hates having to clean off dirty plates when they're in the sink, especially when they have food on them. To combat this we added a robotic arm that will scrape the food off the plates. This food will then fall into a garbage disposal and the dishes will automatically be placed into a dishwasher. Now you don't have to worry about touching dirty dishes!

                            Having to constantly check calendars, schedules, watches, phones, clocks, anything can get pretty inconvenient at times. However, we've added small speakers to each room that can be voice activated to announce the current time, date, and other information regarding potential events or schedules. Now, you can stay up to date in any room by simply asking. Also, the speakers will announce the time at the start of every hour except at night.

                        Literature is one of the greatest forms of art to ever exist on this planet. Words can be used to convey so much meaning and it is important that these works are appreciated. Some examples of the finest literary art come from poetry. These concise works, although small, contain powerful and deep meanings that can really make you think. So, we now offer a poetry reader that is built into the study that is able to read off different works of poetry! This reader comes with tons of options as well, such as favorites, explanations, and custom poetry. Having our system read off different works of poetry can be great for relaxing after a long day.

                        One of our newest and most advanced features is a nursery that can transform into any location on the planet. The nursery allows the user to transform the walls, floor, and ceiling into a location thousands of miles away! For example, you could make the room look like the Amazonian Jungle, or the Serengeti, or whatever you could imagine! This is perfect for children who want to explore and see the world without the dangers. It's also perfect for babies, who would most definetly benefit from a more relaxing and calm environment. Our studies have shown that with this media room, babies and younger children experienced an almost 90% increase in their overall happiness and wellbeing. This feature is a no-brainer if you currently have, or are planning to have, children.
