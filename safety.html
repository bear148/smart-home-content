            <p>When it comes to your safety, it is incredibly important to us that it is our top priority when it comes to deciding what we include in this house. Therefore, we've included plenty of different features that will ensure your safety when your either in the home, or even away. The safety features of our house range from doors with keypads, to automatic shutters that can either close or open to keep potential criminals out of your house.</p>
            <section>
                <h3>Ammenity List</h3>
                <p>Here is a comprehensive list and description for all of the safety ammenities we include:</p>
                <h4>Natural Threats</h4>

                        The most important part in being safe, especially during a fire, is knowing about it as soon as possible so you and your family are aware that it is being handled, or if necessary, to leave. Our fire alarms announce across the house when a fire has been detected. These fire alarms not only notify you, but they notify the brain in the attic to begin initiating fire defense protocols.

                    <figcaption>
                        One of the most important features of the fire fighting aspect of our saftey ammenities is the pipes, or <q>snakes</q> that deploy out of the walls to extinguish any fires that couldn't have been tamed by the base fire safety system. These <q>snakes</q> have incredibly fast deployment times and are incredibly effective in putting out fires.

                    <img src="/images/robotfirefighters.png" alt="Robot Firefighters">
                    <figcaption>
                        Everyone knows that when theres a fire, firefighters are the ones called upon to put out said fire. So, we added robotic firefighters that, when deployed, will effectively fight a fire as to prevent as much damage as possible. These firefighting robots use the same chemical as the snakes to both extinguish the fire, and act as a retardant to prevent it from spreading.

                <figure id="rats">
                    <img src="/images/roboticrats.png" alt="Firefighting Rats">
                    <figcaption>
                        Along with the mice mentioned in the convenience ammenities, there are rats that accompany these mice as well. These rats act as fire fighters by carrying small buckets that carry water that they can then dump on a fire. These rats are usually only deployed for smaller fires that have been detected. This is to prevent the overreaction to a fire which can drain the reserve supply of fire retardant the Robot Firefighters and Snakes rely on.

                <h4>Human Threats</h4>
                <figure>
                    <img src="/images/autoshutters.png" alt="Automatic Shutters">
                    <figcaption>
                        Criminals often choose to break into houses through weakpoints like windows or doors. Therefore, we include shutters that can automatically close when the main computer may have detected a possible intruder. These shutters can close shut in a secure way as to prevent damage being done to the home. This feature has been thoroughly test and has proven numerous times it can withstand the blunt force from impacts, which makes this the perfect addition to your home.

                <figure>
                    <img src="/images/keypadvoice.png" alt="Password Keypad and Voice">
                    <figcaption>
                        As an extra security measure, we've added both a keypad and voice recognition to the front door. This will make it both easier, and harder to get in through the front door. It makes it easier because you can simply tell the door to open. It will make entry harder by making it so any potential criminals can not enter through the front door without trying to forcefully entire. This will then trip a detection system in the brain and cause the door to be locked until someone with keypad access is able to deactivate it.
