            <p>When it comes to your safety, it is incredibly important to us that it is our top priority when it comes to deciding what we include in this house. Therefore, we've included plenty of different features that will ensure your safety when your either in the home, or even away. The safety features of our house range from doors with keypads, to automatic shutters that can either close or open to keep potential criminals out of your house.</p>

                    <p>
                        The most important part in being safe, especially during a fire, is knowing about it as soon as possible so you and your family are aware that it is being handled, or if necessary, to leave. Our fire alarms announce across the house when a fire has been detected. These fire alarms not only notify you, but they notify the brain in the attic to begin initiating fire defense protocols.

                    <p>
                        One of the most important features of the fire fighting aspect of our safety amenities is the pipes, or <q>snakes</q> that deploy out of the walls to extinguish any fires that couldn't have been tamed by the base fire safety system. These <q>snakes</q> have incredibly fast deployment times and are incredibly effective in putting out fires.

                    <p>
                        Everyone knows that when theres a fire, firefighters are the ones called upon to put out said fire. So, we added robotic firefighters that will effectively fight a fire as to prevent as much damage as possible. These firefighting robots use the same chemical as the snakes to both extinguish the fire, and act as a retardant to prevent it from spreading.

                    <p>
                        Along with the mice mentioned in the convenience amenities, there are rats that accompany these mice as well. These rats act as fire fighters by carrying small buckets that carry water that they can then dump on a fire. These rats are usually only deployed for smaller fires that have been detected.

                    <p>
                        To fend off criminals, we include shutters that can automatically close when the main computer has detected a possible intruder. These shutters can close shut in a secure way as to prevent damage being done to the home. This feature has been thoroughly tested and has proven numerous times it can withstand the blunt force from different kinds of impacts. This makes it the perfect addition to your home.

                    <p>
                        As an extra security measure, we've added both a keypad and voice recognition to the front door. This will make it both easier, and harder to get in through the front door. It makes it easier because you can simply tell the door to open via the voice recognition. It will make entry harder by making it so any potential criminals can not enter through the front door without trying to forcefully enter.
